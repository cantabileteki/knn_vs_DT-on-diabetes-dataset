# knn vs DT on diabetes dataset
This is a project about comparing and analyzing the prediction performance of KNN and Decision Tree algorithms applied on the diabetes dataset.                        

Firstly process the diabetes dataset: I detectd the outliers for each feature and analyzed how to process with them, then 
respectively apply KNN and Decision Tree on dataset using cross validation to predict desease outcomes, compare and analyze their accuracies,  precisions, recalls, F1 scores etc.
